# Breaker Profile — RHC Project

## Overview
The **Breaker** role focuses on evaluating the security guarantees of the Randomized Header Channel (RHC), identifying weaknesses, and proposing improvements. Breakers validate the model through offensive testing and threat modeling.

## Responsibilities
- Evaluate the effectiveness of header rotation entropy.
- Attempt interception, replay, automation, and prediction attacks.
- Analyze security gaps in client and server integration.
- Perform fuzzing, header manipulation, and malformed-request attacks.
- Contribute to the Threat Model and Risk Assessment sections.
- Review Builder implementations for potential bypasses.

## Skills Required
- Expertise in web security and offensive techniques.
- Familiarity with HTTP protocol internals and serialization layers.
- Experience with Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Postman, or custom tooling.
- Ability to write exploits or proof-of-concept attacks.
- Understanding of CSRF attack vectors and token transport weaknesses.

## Contribution Areas
- Security test suites.
- PoC attacks used for validation.
- Threat modeling documentation.
- Vulnerability disclosure and patch proposals.
